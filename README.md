# MalHow

This binary was created to be a training executable for malware analysis. It does not contain actual malware, but it is helpful for understanding behavioral elements of malware, and creates an opportunity for budding malware analysts and reverse engineers to safely practice their skills.

See the "questions.md" document for some specific questions that are often asked in researching and triaging malware. 

If you get stuck, see the MalHow "hints.md" file

If you get REALLY stuck, see the "answers.md" file.

## NOTE  
After some debate, I devided to publish the source code along with it, and not just the binary and Q&A part.  
It seemed to me that this might be a good place for a beginner to use reverse engineering techniques and compare how close they are to the actual code.  
This might help someone understand how the two correlate (or, in some cases, might not seem to).
