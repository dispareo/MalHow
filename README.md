This binary was created to be a training executable for malware analysis. It does not contain actual malware, but it is helpful for understanding behavioral elements of malware, and creates an opportunity for budding malware analysts and reverse engineers to safely practice their skills.

See the "questions.md" document for some specific questions that are often asked in researching and triaging malware.
